# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1.	Python Basics
What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Key features include:
- Easy to read and write: Python's syntax is clear and concise.
- Versatile: Suitable for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, etc.
- Extensive Libraries: Rich standard library and many third-party packages.
- Community Support: Large community providing support and contributions.

Examples of use cases:
- Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
- Data Analysis: Libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- Machine Learning: Frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
- Automation: Scripting and automating repetitive tasks.
2.	Installing Python
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Installation Steps:
- **Windows:**
  1. Download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).
  2. Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH."
  3. Follow the installation prompts.

- **macOS:**
  1. Install Homebrew if not already installed (`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`).
  2. Run `brew install python`.

- **Linux:**
  1. Update package list: `sudo apt update`.
  2. Install Python: `sudo apt install python3`.

Verify Installation:
  - Run `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal.

Set up a Virtual Environment:
  1. Install `virtualenv`: `pip install virtualenv`.
  2. Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv` or `python -m venv venv`.
  3. Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3.	Python Syntax and Semantics
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
Simple Python Program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Explanation:
- `print()`: This is a built-in function in Python used to output text to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"`: This is a string literal, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
4.	Data Types and Variables
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Basic Data Types:
- **int**: Integer numbers, e.g., `42`.
- **float**: Floating-point numbers, e.g., `3.14`.
- **str**: String of characters, e.g., `"Hello"`.
- **bool**: Boolean values, `True` or `False`.
- **list**: Ordered sequence of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **dict**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`.

Example Script:
```python
# Integer
x = 10
print(x, type(x))

# Float
y = 3.14
print(y, type(y))

# String
z = "Hello"
print(z, type(z))

# Boolean
is_valid = True
print(is_valid, type(is_valid))

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers, type(numbers))

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person, type(person))
```
5.	Control Structures
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.
Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions. The most common are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Example of if-else statement:
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```
Loops:
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The most common are `for` and `while` loops.

Example of a for loop:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```
6.	Functions in Python
What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing repetition, and improving readability.

Example Function:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```
7.	Lists and Dictionaries
Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Differences:
- **List**: An ordered collection of items. Elements are accessed by their index.
- **Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Elements are accessed by their key.

Example Script:
```python
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)
print(numbers[2])  # Accessing third element

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person)
person["city"] = "New York"
print(person)
print(person["name"])  # Accessing value by key
```
Exception Handling
What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
8.	Exception Handling:
Exception handling is a way to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue its execution or fail gracefully.

Example:
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed")
```
9.	Modules and Packages
Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.
Modules and Packages:
- **Module**: A file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
- **Package**: A collection of modules organized in directories.

Importing and Using a Module:
Example using the `math` module:
```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)       # Output: 3.141592653589793
```
10.	File I/O
How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from a File:
```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
Writing to a File:
```python
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
```
